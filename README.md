pacmoney
========

PacMoney maps creates a data visualization of campaign finance data based on FEC's open data set. Javascript library d3.js is used for the data viz.

The current implementation uses Open Secret's version of the data set. (http://www.opensecrets.org/resources/create/data.php)

A sample site is hosted at  http://54.225.85.154/

This is still a work in progress, especially with UI tweaks needed.
